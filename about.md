# Google+ Button

Ever missed the good old Google+ buttons from 1.3? Well, they're back now!

Google+ Button is a mod which brings back the Google+ button next to the profile button.
This means the mod is actually pretty useless, because Google+ got deprecated in 2019. (_bruh_)

# How to use

Click the Google+ Button in the main menu.
